## Reducing Screen Time

At the start of the New Year, I made a conscious decision to reduce the amount of time I spent on my phone. I realized that the only apps that consumed most of my time were the popular social media platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube. Although I never used TikTok, I had installed it once, but found it overwhelming and harmful to my device.

With this in mind, I decided to delete all these time-consuming apps, bidding farewell to Instagram and Snapchat, and significantly reducing my YouTube watch time to just 10 minutes per day. Unfortunately, due to my phone's Android system, I couldn't delete YouTube altogether, but limiting my time on it was the best option.

## Digital Wellbeing

Digital wellbeing is the conscious and intentional use of technology to improve our overall physical, mental, and emotional health. In today's fast-paced digital world, it is essential to be mindful of our screen time and usage of technology to prevent negative impacts on our health and wellbeing. The excessive use of technology can lead to addiction, sleep deprivation, anxiety, and other mental health issues. To promote digital wellbeing, we should set boundaries, take regular breaks from our devices, engage in physical activities, and prioritize social interactions in the real world. Practicing digital wellbeing not only improves our health and wellbeing, but it also enhances our productivity, creativity, and ability to connect with others meaningfully.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, reducing the time spent on our phones and practicing digital wellbeing are crucial steps in maintaining a healthy and fulfilling life in today's digital age. It is important to recognize the negative impacts that technology can have on our physical, mental, and emotional health and take proactive measures to mitigate them. By prioritizing our overall wellbeing and consciously using technology in a positive way, we can lead more balanced and fulfilling lives. So, let's take the time to unplug, recharge, and connect with ourselves and those around us in the real world.
