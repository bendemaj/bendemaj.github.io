## In Corpore Sano

In August 2021 I decided to start taking care of my physical health. So I did what every sane person would do at this point, I bought myself a years gym membership. My local gym was within walking distance so it was perfect but nevertheless I got there most of the times by car (it was more comfortable I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). 

The first time wasn't that big of a deal but yeah you sure do behave as a beginner when you get on the machines for the first time. Luckily I had a friend who was working out for months so he gave me good advice for beginners in the gym.

```
Start Training with only machines
Adjust the weight on each Machine so you can do 10 reps 
```
With this in my mind I started my journey of becoming more healthy and put on a bit of muscle.

## Status

I am 184 cm tall and weigh about 83 kg. So I have a bit of a mass to work with but I have no muscle whatsoever, I have a slim upper body and a tiny belly with some love handles. The best thing you can do now when you are in a similiar situation is to write down some goals.

## Goals

My goal is now to put on mass to 90 kg bodyweight and get overall stronger. I want to build a better upper body (broad shoulders, large chest). So I would fill out my shirts and look more fit.


I hope this post might even you get to working out. I will definitely keep you updated, thus being a long process of achicheving a great physique.
